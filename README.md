# Voting helper

Perhaps a description will follow here some time.

## Usage

Make a copy of `conf.example.ini` called `conf.ini` and change the values as you require.

Invoke `./vote.py` with:
- **vote**: to try and vote once
- **watch** to watch with the defined interval and try to vote

Invoke `./vote.py watch` on the command line to watch and automatically vote.
